--   Login Screen and and Sign Up Screen is Static. No Authentication code is there because it is not necessary.
--   First page after login is User dashboard where Search bar and Search button is used to search Recipe.
     (Click to view favourite list) button is used for viewing your favourite recipe list
     (Click to empty your favourite list) button is used to clear your favourite list data
